# Why do you have to pay to use Ethereum?

## Answer

Every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network requires computational resources. Miners must be incentivized to process these transactions and create blocks, therefore users pay a small fee per transaction for this.

## Explanation

Many blockchains that boast that they are "free" are simply obfuscating the real cost of the transactions on its network. A "free" blockchain may not charge the user for the transaction fees directly via gas but they do usually require users to pay fees in a variety of indirect ways such as smart contract owners paying the fees and passing them onto the user through the function of the contract, requiring users or DApp owners to lock funds for bandwidth, and/or paying through inflation by overpaying a set of block producers.
