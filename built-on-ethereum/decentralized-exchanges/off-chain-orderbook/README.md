# Off-Chain Orderbook

For "Off-Chain Orderbook" decentralized exchanges, final trades occur on chain but every order is hosted by a third party called a Relayer. This was the style of many early generation decentralized exchanges built on Ethereum.

## Exchanges

* [0x Protocol](0x-protocol/)
* [EtherDelta](etherdelta.md)
* [Loopring](loopring.md)
* [IDEX](idex.md)
* [Hydro](Hydro.md)

## Pros

* Faster order management than On-Chain solutions
* Less fees involved than On-Chain solutions

## Cons

* No full guarantee that a maker order is still active
* The relayer could front run an order
