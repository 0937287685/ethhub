# Ethlance

## Description

Ethlance is a freelance platform.

The listings include required skills, pricing, and the description of what needs to be done. Payments are done with ether. Ethlance doesn’t hold any funds, as all payments are made directly from employer to the freelancer.

Ethlance doesn’t impose any fees for employer or freelancer. All listings are stored on Ethereum and IPFS, thus anyone can access them.

Ethlance also supports job sponsorships. If the creator opted into sponsorship during listing creation, anyone will be able to chip in. Collected funds will be used to pay the freelancer who will complete the task. Unused funds will be returned to contributors. Therefore, it’s possible to crowdfund “public good” tasks.
