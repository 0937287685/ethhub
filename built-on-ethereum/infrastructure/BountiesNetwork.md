# Bounties Network

## Description

Bounties Network is a general-purpose bounty protocol. Bounty creators can incentivize work by offering ether or tokens in exchange for getting something done. The funds are locking into escrow, and released to the worker on successful submission.

Other projects can use the protocol to build marketplaces for specific kind of tasks. For example, Gitcoin uses Bounties Network to incentivize open source contributions.
