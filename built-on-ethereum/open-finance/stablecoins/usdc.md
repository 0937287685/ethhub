# USDC

On October 23, 2018, Coinbase and Circle announced that they would release an ERC20 token pegged to the US Dollar called USD Coin (USDC). USDC is a stablecoin developed by the Centre Consortium, a collaboration between Coinbase and Circle Internet Financial (Circle). Circle is the issuer of USDC. All issuers use a reserve bank account to hold US Dollars that back USDC in circulation. Each USDC represents a single US dollar (USD), and is meant to not move up and down significantly in terms of its exchange rate. 

## Issuer Requirements
Commercial issuers of USDC will be required by CENTRE to:

* Hold any / all applicable licenses in their operating jurisdictions
* Have audited AML and Compliance programs that meet FATF standards
* Hold reserves on a 1:1 basis with issued tokens and provide monthly published proof of reserves attested to by certified public auditors
* Support fungible exchange and redemption of USDC tokens from other authorized issuer members
* Meet other reporting and review requirements established by CENTRE


## Auditing Process
Grant Thornton LLP, an independent accounting firm, will provide USDC attestation reports on Circle’s USDC reserves on a monthly basis. These reports can be found [here](https://www.centre.io/usdc-transparency).


## Risk of Frozen or Blacklisted Accounts
USDC transactions are monitored for transactions that relate to "restricted activities." These transactions are seen as prohibited and can expose the USDC account to the risk of having their account frozen, blacklisted, and/or their funds seized.

From the [Circle USDC User Agreement](https://support.usdc.circle.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001233386-Circle-USDC-User-Agreement):
> Circle reserves the right to “blacklist” certain USDC addresses and freeze associated USDC (temporarily or permanently) that it determines, in its sole discretion, are associated with illegal activity or activity that otherwise violates the terms of this User Agreement (“Blacklisted Addresses”).  In the event that you send USDC to a Blacklisted Address, or receive USDC from a Blacklisted Address, Circle may freeze such USDC and take steps to terminate your USDC Account.  In certain circumstances, Circle may deem it necessary to report such suspected illegal activity to applicable law enforcement agencies and you may forfeit any rights associated with your USDC, including the ability to redeem USDC for U.S. Dollars.  Circle may also be forced to freeze USDC and/or surrender associated U.S. Dollars held in Segregated Accounts in the event it receives a legal order from a valid government authority requiring it to do so.
