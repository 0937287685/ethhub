# Stablecoins

## What are Stablecoins?

A useful currency should be a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Cryptocurrencies excel at the first, but as a store of value or unit of account, theyâ€™re pretty bad. You cannot be an effective store of value if your price fluctuates by 20% on a normal day.

This is where stablecoins come in. Stablecoins are price-stable cryptocurrencies, meaning the market price of a stablecoin is pegged to another stable asset, like the US dollar.

All stablecoins imply a peg. Stablecoins generally peg to the US dollar \(so each stablecoin trades at $1\), but they sometimes peg to other major currencies or to the consumer price index.
