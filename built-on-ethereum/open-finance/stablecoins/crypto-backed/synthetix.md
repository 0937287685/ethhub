### What is Havven (NUSD)?

Dai is an asset-backed stable currency created by the Maker Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(MakerDAO\). The Dai Stablecoin system maintains the stable value of Dai by ensuring that each Dai is always backed by a collateralized asset of more value. Single collateral Dai requires that each Dai is backed by at least 150% Ether. If at anytime, the amount of collateral backing Dai falls below 150%, "watchers" \(community run bots\) will call functions within the MakerDAO smart contracts that trigger liquidation of enough collateral to payback the debt.
