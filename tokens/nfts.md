# Non-fungible Tokens \(NFTs\)

## What does “fungible” mean?!

If an item is fungible, then it can be substituted or exchanged for any similar item. Fiat currencies, like the US dollar, contain fungible units. One dollar bill can be exchanged for any other dollar bill. Cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and MANA are all fungible because one token can be exchanged for any other token. The only thing that changes is a record on the blockchain registering the transaction.

It must follow that two non-fungible tokens are not interchangeable. So what is it about non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that gives them this quality? The answer lies in the data or information stored within NFTs.

We can compare two real-world examples of fungible and non-fungible items that most people should be familiar with: dollars and movie tickets.

### Dollars

These are obviously fungible, if I have a dollar and you have a dollar, we can trade the two and neither of us will be any richer or poorer than we were before.

### Movie tickets

NFTs are the digital manifestation of items like movie tickets, in that they can contain information in addition to just the owner, lending them all sorts of uses and unforeseen value.

## ERC721

ERC721 was written to standardize non-fungible tokens. By standardizing NFTs, the developer community ushered in a new ecosystem of digital content, games, and applications that use NFTs. Thanks to ERC721, we have things like Decentraland, CryptoBeasties, Etheremon, and CryptoKitties.
