# Ethereum Scaling Fundraising Event

### Motivation

A recent [discussion](https://twitter.com/preston_vanloon/status/1075174335554469888) on Twitter highlighted the fact that teams working on Ethereum scaling solutions aren't able to dedicate their full time to their projects because of funding issues. The Ethereum Foundation gives out grants to many of these teams but it's not enough to pay full time salaries for very long and it shouldn't be expected that the Ethereum Foundation fully fund every team out there.  
  
ETH holders have an incentive to fund these teams for long term success of the network but there is no formal process for this to occur. Knowing which teams to donate to, what addresses are legit and how the funds will be used are barrier.  It seems that there could be a solution to this by running a fundraiser event for the entire Ethereum network. 

### Format

This type of idea could be accomplished entirely decentralized through a DAO but it's important to remove complexity given the immediate need for funding due to the active Eth 2.0 research. We suggest the following format for the fundraising to occur:

* Website is created for the event at a name such as EthScalingFunding.com
* Ethereum Foundation selects 5 projects they see as most important for the success of Eth 2.0. This will give assurance to donators that every projects in the fundraiser is credible.
  * NOTE: This could be done through EthHub or a panel of community members but again adds potential unnecessary complexity.
* Every project selected is put on the website with a "kickerstarer style" pitch of their raise goal and what the funds will be used for.
* Event runs for 30 days. If entire funding goal is not reached, funds are returned to those that donated.

### Smart Contract

The entire funding initiative is run via smart contract. This contracts core function will be:

* Direct link to each project's funding wallet
* Implemented time limit of 30 days from start of funding
* Knowledge of each project's funding goal in ETH
* Ability to return funds to donators if funding goal is not reached within 30 days.
* Ability to unlock funds for project if funding goal is reached within 30 days.
