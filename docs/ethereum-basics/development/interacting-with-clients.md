# Interacting with an Ethereum Client: JSON-RPC

JSON-RPC is the primary protocol used by Ethereum and bitcoin. JSON-RPC is very simple, and transport agnostic, however, within ethereum, JSON-RPC is supported over HTTP, IPC and websockets.

## Ethereum JSON-RPC Specification

There exists a specification for ethereum JSON-RPC that is expected to be implemented by all client developers. The OpenRPC document can be found [here](https://github.com/etclabscore/ethereum-json-rpc-specification/blob/master/openrpc.json).

Within the above linked repo you will also find generated code for making RPC calls to any ethereum client.
