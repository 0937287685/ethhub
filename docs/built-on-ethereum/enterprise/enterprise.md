# Enterprise

**Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)**

Industry leaders are now realizing the true potential of blockchain and ethereum. EEA is a member-driven standards organization whose charter is to develop open 
blockchain specifications that drive harmonization and interoperability for businesses and consumers worldwide.

EEA has more than 200 members now with big names like microsoft, JPM etc. Many of the EEA members are going through and researching into ethereum to support to 
fit it into their use case. You can see the list of all the members [here](https://entethalliance.org/members/).

## JPM

### Summary
JPM is working on blockchain solutions for business. It launched **Quorum**, an open source blockchain platform that combines the innovation of the public 
Ethereum community with enhancements to support enterprise needs. Quorum help alleviate major banking issues such as settlement times, risk exposure, and system 
breakdowns. Since it is a permissioned network, no need for POW/POS and instead it has it's own alternative consensus mechanisms which in turn gives higher 
perfomance due to faster blocktimes, transaction finality, and on-demand block creation.<br/>
JPM is also working on their own coin (JPM Coin), built on quorum that enables the instantaneous transfer of payments between institutional accounts.

Besides quorum, JPM has developed a privacy feature for ethereum-based blockchains, obscuring not only how much money is being sent but who is sending it.
It is an extension to the Zether protocol which not only conceals the account balances and the transfer amounts but the sender may also hide herself and the 
transactions recipients in a larger group of parties.

## Microsoft

### Summary
Microsoft along with Enterprise Ethereum Allaince (EEA) launched a token-building-kit to help businesses design and create the right sort of crypto tokens for 
their particular needs. According to microsoft, "a business person can create a token visually using a design tool that does not involve writing any code 
whatsoever, and allows them to then say to developers, 'I want one of these.'"

Recently they also released a suite of tools allowing clients to build ethereum-based apps on its cloud computing platform Azure. The new Azure Blockchain 
Development Kit for Ethereum will help developers create and deploy ethereum-based apps on Azure Blockchain Service or the ethereum blockchain. It was released 
as an extension of it's very powerful Visual Studio Code.

Microsoft is also working with starbucks to harness this Azure Blockchain Service in tracking coffee shipments from across the world, bringing "digital, 
real-time traceability" to its supply chains.

## Ernest and Young (EY)

### Summary
EY is rolling out free software designed to help corporate clients use the ethereum blockchain. Recently they announced a protocol, internally code-named 
Nightfall, which has been developed over the last year by a team of over 200 blockchain developers. The protocol is created for such use cases as supply chains, 
food tracing, transactions between branches of a company and public finance. It takes advantage of Zero Knowledge Proofs to allow private txs on a shared ledger.

Unlike other enterprise blockchain platforms, Nightfall is supposed to run on top of public ethereum network not private. EY has already released the code with 
no permissive copyright license.

## Deloitte

### Summary
Deloitte has a dedicated team (EMEA blockchain lab) exploring blockchain capabilities. Recently it partenered with Institute of Banking (IoB), Bank of Ireland, 
AIB and Ulster Bank to develop an Ethereum-based tool which facilitate wide range of staff-related data management processes. It is currently in beta test mode 
and a full rollout can be expected by summer 2020.
The new platform is a first in the European financial services industry and will support the verification, tracking, direct access to, and management of, 
regulatory and other professional designations, education qualifications and lifelong learning credentials.

## MetLife

### Summary
MetLife is utilizing the live public Ethereum blockchain to add transparency and efficiency to the life insurance claims process. MetLife's Singapore-based 
incubator LumenLab is collaborating with Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) and NTUC Income (Income) on a platform of smart contracts known as 'Lifechain' to help 
loved ones quickly determine if the deceased was protected with a policy and automatically file a claim. This move by metlife can destroy the life insurance 
industry worth $ 2.7trillion.

If a family choose to participate, Lifechain will encrypt the deceased's National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) number (which is included in the Death 
Certificate) using a hashing algorithm and place it onto the blockchain. This will trigger a search on NTUC’s end for a matching life insurance policy. If a 
match is found, "SPH will inform family members within one working day, while 'Lifechain' will send an automatic notification to Income via email to initiate 
the claims process." 

This is not MetLife's first experimentation with blockchain. In fact, the core smart contract platform that constitutes Lifechain is very closely related to 
what was built for the company’s first successful pilot, a mobile app called Vitana, that utilized Ethereum to pay out claims to expectant mothers who 
contracted gestational diabetes.

## Google

### Summary
Google just dropped a bomb by announcing parternship with chainlink to build hybrid blockchain/cloud applications. The blog posted by Google describes that the 
team is working on applications of making internet-hosted data available inside an immutable public blockchain: placing BigQuery data available on-chain using a 
Chainlink oracle smart contract.

BigQuery allows large swathes of data from multiple blockchains to be correlated and analyzed. The datasets have been used to develop processes such as profit 
sharing, characterizing network participants, and detecting software vulnerabilities and malware.

Chainlink will act as the "middleware" between smart contracts and Google's real-world data, and provide a secure on and off ramp for the outside information 
they need. At a high level, Ethereum Dapps request data from Chainlink, which in turn retrieves data from a web service built with Google App Engine and 
BigQuery.

Chainlink partenering with google opens up the gate for innumerable applications.

## AXA

### Summary
AXA, the insurance giant and the world’s second biggest financial company has launched an insurance product that utilizes smart contracts on ethereum's public 
blockchain called **Fizzy**.

When you buy flight delay insurance on the fizzy platform, purchase is recorded on ethereum blockchain, making the insurance contract equally tamperproof. This 
smart contract is connected to global air traffic databases, so as soon as a delay of more than two hours is observed, compensation is triggered automatically. 
In this way, AXA has delegated the compensation decision to an independent network.
