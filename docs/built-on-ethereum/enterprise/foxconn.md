# Foxconn

## Summary
Foxconn – best known for manufacturing Apple’s iPhone launched a Shanghai startup called **Chained Finance** with a Chinese peer-to-peer lender. Chained will soon connect Foxconn and its many small suppliers (and their suppliers' suppliers) on an Ethereum-based blockchain that will use its own token and smart contracts to make payments and provide financing in near real time, eliminating a daisy chain of paperwork.
