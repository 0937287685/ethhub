description: EY is rolling out Nightfall

# Ernst and Young (EY)

## Summary
EY is rolling out free software designed to help corporate clients use the ethereum blockchain. Recently they announced a protocol, internally code-named **Nightfall**, which has been developed over the last year by a team of over 200 blockchain developers. The protocol is created for such use cases as supply chains, food tracing, transactions between branches of a company and public finance. It takes advantage of Zero Knowledge Proofs to allow private txs on a shared ledger.

Unlike other enterprise blockchain platforms, Nightfall is supposed to run on top of public ethereum network not private. EY has already released the code with no permissive copyright license.
