# Synthetix

## Summary

Synthetix is a decentralized platform on Ethereum for the creation of Synths: on-chain synthetic assets that track the value of real-world assets. Born as stablecoin project Havven, [launched first USD pegged stablecoin in June 2018](https://blog.havven.io/nusd-launches-today-e24fbe0ee9c9). [Havven rebranded as Synthetix](https://blog.havven.io/havven-is-transforming-into-synthetix-2fdf727b8892) and expanded its scope to a synthetic asset platform [launching on mainnet December 2018](https://blog.synthetix.io/launch-synths-are-now-live-on-mainnet/). As of June 2019, the Synthetix platform supports over 20 Synths representing fiat currencies, commodities (e.g., gold), and cryptoassets. Stocks, indices, and other derivatives are expected to be added soon. It is one of the only platforms that supports shorting some tokens via the Synthetic inverse tokens such as iMKR, iXTZ, iBNB, iETH, iBTC.

## How Synthetix Works

Synthetix has a native token called SNX. Holders lock SNX as collateral to mint Synths, which are freely tradeable ERC20 tokens. Trading fees from Synths exchanged on Synthetixâ€™s non-custodial DEX, Synthetix.Exchange, go to SNX holders/Synth minters, incentivizing Synth creation and giving value to the underlying collateral (i.e., the SNX token).

## Monetary Policy

Synthetix initially started with supply of 100 million SNX ECR-20 tokens. In February 2019, shortly after the pivot from Havven to Synthetix, a new monetary policy was instituted to encourage staking on the platform while bootstrapping network effects. 
Recognizing the SNX token is fundamentally a work token, and not a currency whose primary purpose is purchasing power, the inflation schedule provides for a sequence of decreasing inflationary rewards to SNX stakers. Under the schedule, SNX increases in supply by 75 million from 100 million to 175 million from March 2019 to March 2020 (75% increase). Running up to March 2021, the SNX supply will increase from 175 million to 212.5 million (21% increase). In March 2022, the SNX supply will reach 231.25 million (9% increase. By March 2023, supply will grow to 240.625 million (4% increase). In March 2024, total supply will hit 245,312,500 SNX (2% increase). 
To mitigate instant dumping of SNX rewards by SNX stakers, which puts downward pressure on SNX price and therefore weakens the value of staked SNX collateral, SNX rewards from March 2019 through March 2020 are locked and cannot be sold on the open market. SNX earned from staking can, however, be collateralized to mint new Synths. 

## Index Synths: sCEX and iCEX

In August 2019, the first exchange index synths went live on Synthetix.exchange. Dubbed sCEX, the sCEX token represents a basket of tokens issued by the top centralized exchanges (CEXs) in the industry: Binance Coin (BNB), Bitfinex's LEO, Huobi's HT, Okex's OKB, and Kucoin's KuCoin Shares (KCS). This basket provides unique exposure to a new strain of synthetic assets that enables traders and investors to gain exposure to the price of several exchanges' tokens without having to own the underlying tokens or maintain an account with one of the represented exchanges. 
When sCEX was introduced, so too was iCEX born, which effectively enables beneficial exposure to downward price movement in the aforementioned tokens. Like iXTZ, iMKR, or iBNB, iCEX appreciates in price when its underlying components depreciate. This is akin to taking a short position, though the parameters of Inverse Synths makes the term inverse more appropriate. 
The inaugural sCEX and iCEX tokens are weighted as follows: BNB (50%), LEO (20%), HT (10%), OKB (10%) and KCS (10%.)
