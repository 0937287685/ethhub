## Summary

> StablePay is a decentralized payment platform that enables users to make payments or donations with Ethereum or other ERC20 tokens, that get instantly converted to DAI token.

## How StablePay Works
The contracts function as a gateway for receiving tokens, seek the best rate for trading on existing decentralized exchanges(Uniswap, Kyber), and swap the tokens to DAI token, to finally send them over to the receiver.
