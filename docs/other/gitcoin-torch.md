# Gitcoin Torch


## Summary

The Gitcoin Torch is a community effort to spur funding of Ethereum projects using the [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) platform. 

## What are you talking about?

The effort contains of two main components, matchers and donators. 

**Matchers** are individuals who have pledged a certain amount of Dai to a matching pool. These funds will be used to match any donation from individuals to a Grant.

**Donators** are individuals who want to direct their own funds towards certain projects. Any donation that is given and asks for a match will be matched using funds from the matching pool. NOTE: Funds donated must be between 10-100 Dai.

## OK great! How do I participate?

Those who want to act as **matchers** should reach out to @econoar on Twitter. Matchers are able to hold their own funds until the end to disperse or can send to an address that acts as a treasury until the end.

Those who want to act as **donators** can head over to Gitcoin Grants and give to their favorite projects and then tag @econoar with proof of the donation.

The Gitcoin Torch effort will run until the pledged matching pool funds have dried up. At that point, all pledged funds will be sent to the appropriate teams.

## Why would I participate?

All projects on Gitcoin Grants are open source. This is a great way to give to teams who are building open source projects that are vital to the future success of Ethereum. Also, it's a great opportunity to make your single donation go further with matching contributions behind it.
