# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based distributed ledger with decentralized control that supports general computing and economic activities. Anyone is able to build and deploy decentralized products and services that run on top of Ethereum by creating highly flexible programmable transactions, called 'smart contracts'. This smart contract technology has proven to be attractive to developers since it enables them to create programs and business logic that run exactly as coded, trustlessly and with no down time.

Ether is the native cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum network and is used to compensate miners who secure transactions. A planned upgrade to the Ethereum protocol in 2019-2021 would replace mining with a less computationally expensive Proof of Stake mechanism which will be secured by validators, who are also expected to receive a proportional compensation in Ether. Ether also has many current use cases, such as a store of value \(e.g. in lending collateral\), a medium of exchange \(e.g. in trade and payments\), and a unit of account \(e.g. in digital marketplaces\).
