# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based distributed ledger with decentralized control that supports general computing and economic activities. Anyone is able to build and deploy decentralized products and services that run on top of the Ethereum network by creating highly flexible programmable transactions, called 'smart contracts'. This smart contract technology enables anyone to create programs and business logic that run exactly as coded, trustlessly and with no down time.
