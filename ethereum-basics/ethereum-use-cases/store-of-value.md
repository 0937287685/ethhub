# Store of Value

## What gives Ether value?
Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, derives its value from a myriad of different factors.

Ether is primarily used within the Ethereum network to perform a range of functions. Most notably, ether’s functions include:
used to pay ethereum transaction fees (in the form of ‘gas’)
used to participate in ICOs (or other crowdfunding mechanisms)
used as collateral for a wide range of open finance applications (MakerDAO, Compound)
can be lent or borrowed (Dharma)
used to trade crypto-collectibles and other non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
earned as a reward for completing bounties (gitcoin)
accepted as payment at certain retailers

And soon, in Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity), users will be able to participate in securing the network by staking their ether and becoming a validator. The main tangible value add of a Proof of Stake system is that it locks a substantial amount of the supply of the underlying network asset.
There are also discussions around introducing a ‘fee-burn’ model where a percentage of ether used to pay gas fees would be ‘burned’ in order to reduce the circulating supply of ether.

Of course, on top of all of this, we need to discuss ethers speculative value. This is value that is derived purely from speculative activities (such as trading) which currently accounts for most of the use of any crypto-network. As we saw in 2017, crypto-assets are a magnet for unbridled speculation (with some assets increasing in value by 1000x over just a few months). This speculative value isn’t particularly a bad thing — it brings fresh capital into the ecosystem that can be reinvested into various verticals— but it is damaging to the short-term sentiment of all crypto-assets.

The above uses are unarguably functions of money. As you can see, ether is used as the native digital money of the Ethereum open economy and as that economy grows, so does the demand for ether.
